# Core Java and DSA Practice

Welcome to my Java repository! My name is **Polaki Jaya Krishna**, and this is a collection of my practice programs focused on mastering Core Java, Data Structures, and Algorithms (DSA) for learning and practice purposes.

This repository documents my learning journey as I explore and practice fundamental programming concepts.
